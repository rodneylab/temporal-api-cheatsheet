## What is the Temporal API?

The Temporal API is a JavaScript Stage 3 proposal which will make it much easier to
manipulate dates than using the existing `Date` methods. You can try it now (using polyfill shown below) however, as it is still experimental, it is not recommended for production&nbsp;use.
